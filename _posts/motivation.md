## NEVER WASTE A MOTIVATED MOMENT


so basically i was at a company retreat, think its been like 6 months since, and we were doing a teambuilding activity. we each had to go around and say a quote that had made a meaningful difference in our lives. one of my coworkers said ‘never waste a motivated moment’. as he shared his story the quote really resonated with me. i’ve never been the most disciplined person, but i’ve had the sparks of motivation at 3am, the big dreams for my long term future. he put it more eloquently than i will here, but it kind of boils down to letting those sparks of motivation grow into fires as quickly as possible. sparks are weak. when you go to sleep half an hour later, you might wake up the next morning with no memory of what you felt. when you say you’ll ‘just go to the gym later’, something else will get in the way. taking those motivated moments into even just a few minutes or a couple hours of work builds momentum. that momentum turns into results. the sparks turn into a fire that can sustain itself. even this blog post is a motivated moment i’m running with.


i can honestly say that listening to his advice has changed the trajectory my life has been on. i’ve gone from needing every productivity trick in the book to do an hour of leetcode, to putting in 10-12 hour work sessions regularly. i’ve gone from not knowing if i could live up to my ‘potential’ to more conviction in myself than is responsible. it may be hard to see the fruits of the labor, but i can feel it compounding. all you need to do is turn that feeling of ‘i really want to do that right now’, into doing it _right now_


so what do you say? are you gonna waste this motivated moment?

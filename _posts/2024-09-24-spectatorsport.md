> Math is not a spectator sport
- george polya 


when learning, it is really tempting to watch awe-inspiring youtube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs) and [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), read in-depth [blog posts](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM) and bookmark [cheatsheets](https://x.com/novasarc01/status/1833610102240383266) on twitter. as you listen/read/watch, you can feel yourself getting smarter. ‘wow that makes so much sense’, you say, as someone else does the work for you.


in no way do i mean to disparage the incredible work these people have done. i may never have switched from premed to math, if i hadn’t been inspired by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_L-fp8gDzY). i may never have thought i could be a machine learning engineer, if not for [statquest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo)’s explanations. i may not have even studied science at all if not for the stories of my 2nd grade science teacher Mr. Faber. beyond inspiration, karpathy's [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) were immensely helpful for debugging my own implementation of GPT-2. working alongside the hpc algorithmica [textbook](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/) made learning about performance optimization much easier.  


but those intuitions our teachers have passed down to us did not come from just the oral/visual tradition. they came from putting the reps in. it’ll be obvious where you need to apply conditional probability after doing the every problem in the AOPS chapter on it. previously nonsensical pandas operations will form bit by bit after you’ve wrangled with enough messy data. you’ll notice that confusing proof actually was trivial after questioning each and every step of it. lectures, blogs, tutorials are supplementary to the work that needs to be done.


you need to engage with, play with, fight with the material at hand in order to wrest away the understanding hidden inside.
